# Linux Longhorn
✨ Linux Longhorn

Reviving the future we once imagined.

Linux Longhorn is a Linux-based operating system inspired by the visual style and spirit of Windows Longhorn — the legendary version that once promised a bright future, full of harmony between technology and humanity.

This project isn’t just about bringing back the Frutiger Aero aesthetic (glassy transparency, reflections, soft futuristic colors). It’s also a call to reawaken the vision of a better world:
🌿 clean,
💧 crystal-clear,
🤝 peaceful.

Here, nostalgia doesn’t mean limitations.
Linux Longhorn is modern, compatible with today’s software like Steam and Roblox, and designed to be simple for Windows users, without giving up beauty or customization.
What makes it special?

 ❗ Disclamer:
   Linux Longhorn is not a copy, competitor, or protest against what Microsoft created years ago. We are not inciting hate toward the company or its decisions.

   In fact, we deeply admire the vision of the original Longhorn project. It inspired us so much that we decided to reimagine it in our own way, under a new platform, while      honoring many of the aesthetic and conceptual elements that Microsoft once explored.

   This is a tribute, not a challenge.
